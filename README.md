# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed, because it ensures code is continuosly checked for quality. It also ensure that the entire project remains up to date in terms of expected output and performance. 
2. No, because End-to-end testing is a way for developers to automate test cases that involve emulating user actions from start to finish (end to end), rather than the way our code actually acts during certain actions.
3. No, End-to-end testing would be a lot better for this case because is a way for developers to automate test cases that involve emulating user actions from start to finish, assuming the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user. besides if we use unit tests for this case we cannot test how these individual components interact with each other on an application/feature level. 
4. Yes, since unit tests involve testing individual parts of code in encapsulated units to make sure each part of the code is functioning as it should. If a user is only allowed to type 80 characters or less, we need a way to test for this particular task to see if it is working as intended.
